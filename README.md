# Dotfiles

Configuration files for the different machines I've got at home are being kept in the /conf folder. I'm keeping track my own scripts in the /scripts folder, it's mostly the /scripts/python folder that's used nowadays.

And the archive folder will speak for itself.

There might also be some other random stuff in here...
